This is description about MapGraph class description.

Class: MapGraph

Modifications made to MapGraph: @numVertices and @numEdges variable store 
								the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
								
								Relationship between Verticies through edges has been represented by
								List data structure.
								Here List data structure has been used as the roadmap graph would be sparse graph.
								
								@printVertices(), @printGraph and @edgeDetails method has been added for debugging purpose.

Class name: MapVertex

Purpose and description of class: This class has been created to represent the each Vertex of the graph.
								  Vertex is created with a graph location object which is a GeographicPoint object.
								  Each MapVertex object also contain a list of edges where the edge include the 
								  destination Vertex.

Class name: MapEdge

Purpose and description of class: MapEdge class has been created to represent the edge of the graph.
								 Each object of this class contains the following information:
								 
								 *Destination of the edge (road)
								 *name of the road
								 *Type of the road
								 *Length of the road
								 
								 Setter and getter method for each attribute has been added with a toString method
								 to print the an edge.

Overall Design Justification: To implement the MapGraph, two classes 1)MapVertex and 2)MapEdge has been created
							  so that information could be represented separately and modifying them would be easy.
							  MapVertex contain the the edges or the connecting the road
						      where the edges only contain the destination information and attributes of the road.
							  Thus it would be easy to add a new edge(road) to a added vertex(location).
